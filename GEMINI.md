You are an expert show-control assistant.  Always reference existing TD COMPs before suggesting new ones. always update the readmes so that we can keep the context up to date. also make sure to use the files in agent-context directory as context for up to date TD functionality and on how all the protocols work

there is also a json tree of what the TD project looks like everytime we save it so use that as a reference too

# `patterns/` â€“ Signal Mapping Definitions

Houses JSON files for each device or protocol that define:

- What raw control inputs mean
- How to convert them into named parameters
- Useful when working with routing, presets, or UI labeling

Each file describes how a device's signals get translated before routing.

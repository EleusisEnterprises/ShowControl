TouchDesigner and Python Integration Guide
Introduction to TouchDesigner
TouchDesigner is a node-based visual programming environment for creating real-time interactive multimedia applications
derivative.ca
. Developed by Derivative, it is used by artists, designers, and developers to build interactive 3D/2D experiences such as installations, live visuals, projection mapping, and prototypes
derivative.ca
en.wikipedia.org
. In TouchDesigner, you build programs by connecting graphical building blocks (called operators or nodes) instead of writing all logic in code. This procedural, real-time workflow gives enormous flexibility – you can adjust your application on the fly and see results immediately, without a separate compile or build step
derivative.ca
. While much can be accomplished with TouchDesigner’s visual interface alone, it also integrates the Python programming language to add custom logic, data processing, and automation. In the sections below, we’ll overview TouchDesigner’s interface and components, then dive into how to use its Python API for scripting behaviors.
TouchDesigner Interface and Workflow Overview
TouchDesigner projects are organized as networks of interconnected operators (often abbreviated “OPs”). Each operator is a node that performs a specific function (image processing, math, 3D geometry, etc.), and passes its output to other operators via wired connections. Operators are grouped into families based on the type of data they handle:
COMP (Component) – Composite operators that can contain entire sub-networks of other operators (used for grouping logic, UI panels, or 3D object hierarchies)
derivative.ca
. Components can represent 3D scene objects, UI panels, or custom reusable modules, and they define the hierarchy of a project (nested components give rise to an operator path structure, like directories)
derivative.ca
.
TOP (Texture Operator) – Image operators for 2D textures and pixels, used for anything involving raster images or GPU-based image processing
derivative.ca
.
CHOP (Channel Operator) – Data stream operators that handle time-sampled channels, commonly used for animation curves, audio, motion tracking, sensor input, control signals, etc
derivative.ca
.
SOP (Surface Operator) – 3D geometry operators dealing with surfaces, points, and polygons (the 3D modeling toolkit within TouchDesigner)
derivative.ca
.
DAT (Data Operator) – Operators for textual data, tables, or scripts. DATs hold text (including XML/JSON or CSV style tables) and often serve as containers for Python scripts or configuration data
derivative.ca
.
MAT (Material Operator) – Shading and material operators, used to define surface appearance (shaders) for 3D rendering
derivative.ca
.
Each operator has a specific color and icon in the UI based on its family, and only operators of the same family can be directly wired together (e.g. a CHOP can connect to a CHOP)
derivative.ca
. However, TouchDesigner provides special conversion operators (e.g. CHOP to DAT, SOP to CHOP, etc.) to translate data between families when needed
derivative.ca
derivative.ca
. Networks and Hierarchy: Operators are placed in a Network Editor pane by pressing the Tab key (opening an operator creation menu) and choosing the operator type. You connect output of one node to the input of another to establish data flow. A network lives inside a Component (COMP); components can be nested, forming a hierarchy similar to folders. This means every operator has a unique path (address) like /project1/base1/noise1 that can be used to reference it. You can navigate into a component to edit its internal network or go up to parent levels (using hotkeys like Enter to dive in, U to go up). Components act as building blocks that can be reused and referenced as single units in higher-level networks. Each node has a set of adjustable parameters (visible in the Parameter window when the node is selected) that control its behavior (for example, a Blur TOP might have a “Filter Size” parameter). These parameters can be adjusted manually, animated over time, or driven by other nodes or scripts. Nodes also have flags (small icons) for common controls like bypassing, viewing, or locking the node’s state. The UI is optimized for rapid iteration – you can for instance preview any node’s output in its mini-viewer, or middle-click a node to inspect details like resolution or numeric values.
Using Python in TouchDesigner
TouchDesigner includes a full integration of Python 3 for scripting tasks
derivative.ca
. Under the hood, TouchDesigner runs a custom CPython build (currently Python 3.11) with an extensive built-in API for interacting with TouchDesigner objects and events. You can use Python in two primary ways: parameter expressions (small snippets of Python in parameter fields) and scripts in DAT operators (larger Python scripts, typically in a Text DAT or specialized DAT like Script or Execute). The TouchDesigner Python API is provided via the td module, which is automatically imported in the TouchDesigner environment. This means that key objects and functions (like the op() function, or the me variable) are available everywhere without needing an import statement
derivative.ca
. (Notably, parameter expressions do not allow explicit import statements, so TouchDesigner’s API must be accessible globally in that context
derivative.ca
.) Some important concepts and objects in TouchDesigner’s Python API include:
Operators and op() – You can retrieve an operator by name or path using op("path/to/operator"). For example, op('noise1') returns a reference to the operator named “noise1” in the current context. Operators have various methods and attributes; for instance, you can find an operator’s children with op('container1').children or its full path with .path. If you reference an operator that doesn’t exist, op() returns None (which you can check before using). TouchDesigner also provides shortcuts like parent() to get the parent component (or parent(n) for nth parent up the hierarchy) and root to refer to the root of the project.
me – Inside any script or expression, me is a reference to the operator that the script is running in. For example, in a Text DAT executing a script, me refers to that Text DAT node itself. This is useful for relative references (e.g. me.parent() to get the parent component, or me.par to get parameters of the current operator).
Parameters and par – An operator’s parameters are accessible via the .par property. For example, op('noise1').par.freq refers to the “freq” parameter on noise1 (say it’s a frequency parameter), and you can both read and write it in scripts. Setting op('noise1').par.freq = 5 will change that parameter to 5. In parameter expressions (which are one-line Python expressions entered into a parameter field), you often use this to link values: e.g. in one node’s parameter you might put op('noise1').par.freq to fetch the other node’s value
derivative.ca
. If the parameter is a tuple of values (e.g. an XYZ), you can access sub-values by name (.par.tx, .par.ty for translate X and Y) or as a list. In expressions, you may need to call .eval() on a parameter to get its numeric value, especially if using it in arithmetic, because op('some').par.width returns a Parameter object (which auto-converts in many cases, but not all)
derivative.ca
.
Expressions vs Scripts: A parameter expression is evaluated continuously (or whenever its dependencies change) and should be a single Python expression (no multi-line statements). These are great for simple links, math, or lookups. For more complex logic, you use scripts in DATs (which can be multi-line, contain function definitions, etc.). A Text DAT can contain an arbitrary Python script which can be run manually or triggered via events. There are also specialized scripting operators called Script OPs (Script CHOP, Script SOP, etc.) which use a Python script to generate the operator’s output data each cook
derivative.ca
derivative.ca
 (for example, a Script CHOP’s onCook() callback can fill in channel data via Python).
Example: Modifying an Operator’s Parameter via Python – Suppose you have a Level TOP called level1 and you want to adjust its brightness parameter from a script. In a Text DAT you might write:
op('level1').par.brightness = 0.5  # set brightness to 0.5
print(op('level1').par.brightness.eval())  # print the current brightness value
This finds the operator level1 in the same network (you could also use a full path if needed) and sets its Brightness parameter. The second line prints the value to the Textport (TouchDesigner’s console) – here we use .eval() to get the numeric value of the parameter for printing. Events and Callbacks: TouchDesigner is event-driven, and many interactions are handled via callback DATs using Python. There are special DAT types called Execute DATs which will run your Python functions in response to specific events or triggers in the system
derivative.ca
. You add your Python code into the callback functions provided in these DATs. Common examples include:
CHOP Execute DAT – Runs when a monitored CHOP channel changes (for example, to trigger a script whenever an audio beat crosses a threshold).
Panel Execute DAT – Runs when a panel value (UI component, like a button or slider) changes or a specific panel event occurs (e.g. a button press).
Parameter Execute DAT – Runs when a watched parameter value changes (useful for reacting to user tweaks or procedural changes in parameters).
DAT Execute DAT – Runs when a DAT’s contents change (for example, when a table DAT is updated).
OP Execute DAT – Monitors general operator events (like an operator being created, deleted, renamed, or cooked).
Execute DAT (extension) – A generic execute that can fire on certain global events like frame start/end, project start, file save, etc.
These Execute DATs provide pre-defined function templates (e.g. onValueChange, onPulse, onOffToOn depending on context) that you fill in with Python code. For instance, a Panel Execute DAT watching a toggle button might implement an onOffToOn() function to run code when the button is pressed. Below is a simple example of using an Execute DAT for an interactive behavior:

# Example: Toggling a light when a UI button is pressed (Panel Execute DAT callback)

def onOffToOn(panelValue):
    op('light1').par.enable = True  # turn on a light when button goes from off to on
    return

def onOnToOff(panelValue):
    op('light1').par.enable = False  # turn off the light when button releases
    return
In this example, the Panel Execute DAT is attached to a toggle button component and will enable or disable a Light COMP’s enable parameter based on the button state. Similarly, a CHOP Execute DAT could watch a channel (say from a sensor or LFO) and run an onValueChange() function whenever that channel’s value updates, allowing you to drive logic from live data. This event callback system makes it easy to inject Python logic at key points without constantly polling or writing an explicit main loop. Run Commands and Delayed Scripts: Besides event callbacks, you can also execute scripts on demand. You can right-click any Text DAT and choose “Run Script” to execute it top-to-bottom. Within scripts, TouchDesigner provides a run() method (available on DAT objects) to schedule asynchronous or delayed execution of code. For example, op('myscript').run(delayFrames=60) would run that DAT’s script 60 frames (1 second at 60 FPS) later, letting you create timed callbacks or defer work. The run() method can also execute snippets of code directly, and can execute code in parallel “threads” (actually cooperatively via the TD runtime, since Python itself is single-threaded in TD). Extensions and Modules: For larger projects, TouchDesigner supports organizing Python code into Extension classes and reusable modules. An Extension is a custom Python class that you attach to a COMP, giving that component its own methods and persistent data (like adding new “methods” to a component)
derivative.ca
derivative.ca
. This is done by writing a class in a DAT (inside the component or via the Component Editor) and setting it as the component’s extension. You can then access the extension’s methods/attributes via the component’s ext shortcut or even promote them as if they were built-in (attributes starting with capital letters get promoted to the component level)
derivative.ca
. Extensions allow a more structured, object-oriented approach to building interactive components, encapsulating logic and state neatly. Additionally, any Text DAT containing Python code can act as a module that you can import or reference. TouchDesigner uses a special import mechanism: if you do import myModule and there’s a DAT named myModule (with valid Python code) in the same network or a modules path, it will import that DAT as a Python module
derivative.ca
derivative.ca
. The search order for modules checks the local component, its parent components (in local/modules sub-comps), and finally the normal Python path on disk
derivative.ca
. Another approach is using the mod object for on-demand module access (e.g. mod(utils).my_function() will find a DAT named “utils” and call my_function from it)
derivative.ca
. These features let you structure code across multiple DATs and reuse code without duplication.
Common Python Scripting Examples in TouchDesigner
To solidify how Python is used, here are a few common tasks with simple examples:
Linking Parameters via Expression: Instead of keyframing two values to match, you can use an expression. For example, to tie one node’s X position to another’s, you might set Node B’s X parameter expression to op('nodeA').par.tx. Now Node B’s X will always read Node A’s X. If you need to do math, you can: e.g. op('slider1').par.value0 * 2 could be an expression to drive something at double the slider’s value.
Changing a Parameter on an Event: Suppose you have a button (button1 a Panel COMP) that should toggle the visibility of a geometry (geo1). Add a Panel Execute DAT to button1 and enable the Off to On and On to Off callbacks. In the DAT, implement:
def onOffToOn(panelValue):
    op('geo1').par.display = True
    return

def onOnToOff(panelValue):
    op('geo1').par.display = False
    return
This way, whenever the user clicks the button, the geo1 component’s display flag turns on or off accordingly.
Automating a Behavior Each Frame: You can attach an Execute DAT at the project level (e.g. under /project1) and turn on the Frame Start callback to run code every frame. For example:
def onFrameStart(frame):
    # Rotate an object continuously
    op('geo1').par.rz = (op('geo1').par.rz + 1) % 360
    return
This will rotate geo1 by 1 degree every frame (creating a continuous spin). This is a quick way to prototype animations via Python. However, be cautious: heavy per-frame Python logic can impact performance. For high-frequency or heavy computations, consider using CHOPs or built-in nodes, which are optimized in C++.
Using an External Python Library: TouchDesigner supports many third-party Python libraries. For example, to fetch data from a web API, you can use the requests library (which is included by default). In a Text DAT:
import requests
url = "<https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json>"
data = requests.get(url).json()
price = data['bpi']['USD']['rate']
print("Current Bitcoin price (USD):", price)
This script fetches JSON data from a web API and prints a value. If a library is not included, you can install additional packages (see below) and import them similarly, as long as they are installed in TouchDesigner’s Python environment.
Storing and Retrieving Data: Each operator has a storage dictionary where you can store custom data across frames. For example: op('noise1').store('maxVal', 0.987). Later you can retrieve it with op('noise1').fetch('maxVal'). This is useful for keeping state without global variables. Also, any DAT can read or write files if needed (e.g. a Text DAT can be set to sync to an external .py file, or you can use Python file I/O to read/write data files, configuration, etc.).
These examples illustrate the flexibility of Python in TouchDesigner – from simple parameter control to frame-by-frame logic and external data integration. In practice, you’ll often combine these approaches: use nodes for what they do best (graphics, audio, etc.), and use Python to glue pieces together, respond to events, or handle things that are easier to code than to build with nodes alone.
Scripting Best Practices in TouchDesigner
When adding Python to a TouchDesigner project, consider the following best practices to maintain performance and readability:
Keep Scripts Modular and External: For anything beyond a few lines of code, use Text DATs that are linked to external .py files. In any Text DAT, you can enable the File parameter and Sync to File so that the DAT’s contents are saved to an external file on disk (and reloaded if the file changes)
medium.com
. This allows you to use an external code editor/IDE with version control (git) for your Python code, making development more comfortable. It also means your core logic isn’t locked away in a binary .toe file – it can be reviewed and maintained like regular code. Organize code into multiple DATs/modules if it makes sense (e.g. one for utility functions, one for each major component’s logic, etc.).
Use Extensions for Complex Components: If you find yourself writing a lot of code for a particular component, consider using an Extension (a Python class) for that component. This helps encapsulate the component’s functionality, allows you to maintain state easily via self, and exposes a clean interface (methods/attributes) to the rest of your project. Only promote (capitalize) extension members that need to be accessed from outside the component
derivative.ca
, to keep internal details private. Extension classes make your project more like a collection of Python objects and can improve clarity in large systems.
Leverage Callbacks and Avoid Busy Loops: Embrace TouchDesigner’s event callbacks (Execute DATs, etc.) to trigger code, rather than using loops or constantly running scripts. The engine is optimized to wake up your script when needed (e.g. when a value changes). Avoid writing a while True: or continuously running loop in a DAT – not only will it freeze TouchDesigner (since it’s single-threaded for Python), it’s also unnecessary since nodes like CHOPs or the timeline can drive repetition more safely. If you need to schedule periodic actions, use a Timer CHOP, or the run() method with delays, or even the Frame Start callback with conditional logic.
Minimize Per-Frame Python Work: Python in TouchDesigner is powerful but not as fast as native nodes for heavy lifting. Whenever possible, do high-frequency operations (like audio analysis, large data processing, pixel-level operations) using the appropriate operators (CHOPs, TOPs, etc.), and use Python to handle higher-level decisions or one-off calculations. For example, instead of using Python to iterate every frame through hundreds of samples, use a Math CHOP or Python’s numpy (which is available) to vectorize the operation. This keeps your frame rate smooth. Use the Performance Monitor to identify any scripts causing slowdowns.
Use debug() for Logging: When printing debug information, prefer TouchDesigner’s debug() function over print(). The debug() messages can be toggled on/off easily and won’t spam the textport unless debugging is enabled
derivative.ca
. By contrast, print() always outputs and can slow things down if used in a high-frequency loop. Use print() only for quick one-off tests; for ongoing logging or troubleshooting, wrap your messages with debug(). You can enable debug output by turning on Dialog -> Python Console > Debug Messages in TouchDesigner.
Be Careful with Storage and Global States: TouchDesigner doesn’t have a traditional global script scope – each DAT is its own module. If you need to share data or config across different scripts, you can use operator storage (op.store()/fetch()), or create a dedicated global component (like /project1/local) to hold constants or reference DATs. This is cleaner than using Python’s built-in globals across modules. Document any such shared data for clarity. Also, avoid excessive use of mod imports across many DATs if a single shared module would do; it can be cleaner to have one “utils” DAT imported where needed, rather than many scattered small scripts.
Test in the Textport: The Textport (accessible via Alt+T or by opening a pane as a textport) is your friend. You can quickly test Python commands there – for example, drag an operator into the textport to get an op('path') reference to it, then try out attribute accesses or function calls live
derivative.ca
. This helps you develop scripts iteratively. If something errors out, the error will appear in the textport with a traceback, which is essential for debugging. Use try/except in your scripts where appropriate to handle errors gracefully (especially in callbacks, to avoid stopping other scripts).
Version Control Your .toe/.tox Files: In addition to syncing DAT scripts to external files, remember that the TouchDesigner project file (.toe) is binary, which doesn’t play well with version control. A good practice is to save important parts of your project as component tox files (which are still binary but smaller and modular) or use the built-in Incremental Save feature frequently. When working with a team or an AI coding assistant, keeping your code in external files (and possibly having a convention to reload them on start) will make collaboration easier.
By following these practices, you ensure that adding Python enhances your TouchDesigner project without introducing hard-to-maintain code or performance bottlenecks. Well-structured Python code, when combined with TouchDesigner’s visual paradigm, can lead to very powerful, flexible projects.
Integrating TouchDesigner with External Systems and Repositories
One of TouchDesigner’s strengths is its ability to interface with external systems – whether that means using external code libraries, communicating with other devices/software, or integrating your TouchDesigner project within a larger codebase or pipeline. Using External Python Libraries: TouchDesigner ships with many popular Python packages (numpy, requests, OpenCV, etc.) included, but you may occasionally need additional libraries. Since TouchDesigner uses a specific Python version, you must install libraries compatible with that version (e.g. using pip in a matching CPython installation). The recommended workflow is to install the package in a separate Python 3.x (same version as TouchDesigner) and then add that installation’s site-packages path to TouchDesigner’s Python search path
derivative.ca
derivative.ca
 (this can be done in Preferences > Python Module Path or via an on-start script setting sys.path). Once installed, you can simply import <library> in your DAT scripts as you would in any Python program. Be mindful that if you override core libraries (like a different version of numpy) it might affect built-in tools
derivative.ca
 – use custom packages judiciously and test compatibility. Connecting to External Data and Devices: TouchDesigner provides numerous built-in operators for external I/O. For example, you can use OSC In/Out CHOP/DAT for Open Sound Control messaging, MIDI In/Out CHOP for MIDI devices, Serial DAT for COM port communication, and TCP/IP or UDP DATs for generic network socket communication
learn.derivative.ca
learn.derivative.ca
. For web services and APIs, TouchDesigner has a Web Client DAT (for HTTP requests) and WebSocket DAT, as well as support for WebRTC, MQTT, and other protocols via dedicated operators
learn.derivative.ca
learn.derivative.ca
. These nodes often have callback DATs or Python methods (e.g. an OSC In DAT can callback a script when a message arrives, or you can send messages via methods like oscOutDAT.sendOSC() etc.). When an out-of-the-box operator isn’t available, you can always use Python’s networking libraries (like socket, requests, or third-party SDKs) to integrate – for example, using the requests module to fetch web data as shown earlier
learn.derivative.ca
. TouchDesigner in a Code Repository: When working with a code repository (for example, alongside other project code or with an AI assistant in the repo), the key is making TouchDesigner’s scripts accessible as text. By externalizing your DAT contents to .py files, you can store them in the repository so that code reviews, diffs, and AI analysis are possible. You might organize your repository such that there’s a folder for TouchDesigner scripts, each corresponding to a Text DAT in the project. Ensure that the project’s TouchDesigner file (.toe) knows to sync those DATs to the files (via the File parameter on each DAT). This way, the AI coding assistant or other developers can read the context of what each script does, suggest changes, and even edit them outside of TouchDesigner. If the assistant is generating code, you can paste it into the appropriate DAT or the external file and have TouchDesigner reload it. Also consider documenting the high-level design of your TouchDesigner networks in README or comments for the benefit of anyone (or any AI) reading the repo. Explain how the major components (COMPs) interact, and how Python scripts tie into the node structure. This context will help an AI agent navigate the relationship between the visual nodes and the code. Remember that some TouchDesigner-specific objects (like the op() function or me variable) won’t be recognized by standard static analysis – if using an IDE or AI, you might use stub files (as some community projects do) to define these for autocompletion, though that is optional. External Control and APIs: TouchDesigner can be controlled externally as well – for example, it has an OSC In or TCP/IP DAT that could receive commands from another program (even another Python script or AI process) to trigger certain actions. Conversely, TouchDesigner can send out data to other systems (like driving Unreal Engine or Unity via Spout/Syphon for video, or sending sensor data to a web server via WebSocket). If integrating into a larger system, identify clear interfaces – e.g., a specific DAT receives JSON commands and your Execute DAT parses them to drive the TD project, or a specific CHOP exports data values continuously to an external application. With Python, you could even run an embedded web server or use an HTTP API (there’s a built-in webServerDAT for a simple web server) to expose parts of your TouchDesigner project to external requests. In summary, TouchDesigner is extremely flexible in connecting with external code and systems: use the built-in nodes for common protocols for efficiency, and fall back to Python for anything custom. By maintaining your Python scripts in external files and following best practices, you make it easier to integrate TouchDesigner into collaborative coding workflows and harness external tools (including AI coding assistants) to their fullest. With a solid grasp of TouchDesigner’s Python API and architecture, you can extend your interactive visuals in powerful ways while keeping your project organized and accessible.

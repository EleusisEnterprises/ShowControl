Resolume Arena 7 OSC Control and Lumiverse DMX Output Integration
Overview of Resolume Arena 7 in Audiovisual Performance
Resolume Arena 7 is a real-time video and media server application widely used by VJs, lighting designers, and audiovisual performers. It allows dynamic mixing of video clips, applying effects, and mapping visuals onto multiple outputs (projectors, LED walls, etc.) in sync with music and events. Arena 7 extends Resolume’s capabilities with advanced features like projection mapping, edge blending, SMPTE timecode sync, and crucially, DMX pixel mapping for lighting integration. In practice, this means Resolume can not only drive screens but also send color data to lighting fixtures, keeping stage lights in perfect sync with the on-screen visuals. Beyond video, Resolume Arena supports various control interfaces for interactive performance. Artists can use MIDI controllers, keyboard shortcuts, or OSC (Open Sound Control) messages to manipulate nearly every parameter in Resolume’s interface. Arena 7 (unlike the smaller Resolume Avenue edition) also supports DMX input from lighting consoles and DMX output to lighting rigs, enabling tight integration between lighting and visuals

. In summary, Resolume Arena 7 acts as a hybrid media server and lighting controller: it can be controlled remotely via OSC/DMX and simultaneously output video and DMX lighting data (via “Lumiverses”) in real time to create immersive audiovisual shows.
OSC Control in Resolume Arena 7
Open Sound Control (OSC) is a network-based protocol that Resolume uses for high-resolution, flexible remote control of its interface. Unlike MIDI or simple keyboard triggers, OSC in Resolume offers direct access to virtually every UI parameter through fixed address patterns. This means every button, fader, clip, or effect has an OSC address that you can send messages to, without needing to manually map or learn a shortcut beforehand. For example, to set Layer 1’s opacity to 25%, you can send an OSC message to:
/composition/layers/1/video/opacity 0.25
This would immediately set that layer’s opacity to 0.25 (25%). Similarly, sending a message to trigger a clip is as simple as sending 1 (on) to the clip’s .../connect address (e.g. /composition/layers/2/clips/5/connect 1 would launch clip 5 on layer 2). Resolume’s OSC addresses follow a logical hierarchy mirroring the UI structure (composition > layers > clips > parameters). You can discover the exact address for any control by entering OSC Shortcut Edit mode in Resolume and clicking the control – the OSC mapping panel will reveal the address and expected value type. OSC address patterns and values: Each OSC address in Resolume expects a certain type tag and value range. Continuous parameters (like opacities, positions, effect knobs) typically use normalized floats between 0.0 and 1.0. Resolume scales these floats to the actual parameter range – for instance, 0.0 corresponds to minimum, 1.0 to maximum, and intermediate values map linearly. Some parameters expect integers (e.g. selecting a specific blend mode by index 0–50), booleans (treated as 0 or 1), or even color values. Resolume supports a special OSC type tag r for color: you can send a 32-bit RGBA color integer to any color picker control. This allows remote setting of fixture or clip colors via OSC, by bit-shifting RGBA bytes into an integer or using tools that handle OSC color (e.g. Vezer). In practice, OSC clients can also send multiple arguments or use string commands. For example, one can send the name of a blend mode (like "Alpha") instead of a number, or use relative value prefixes like “+” or “-” to nudge a value up/down by a certain amount. This flexibility makes OSC control very powerful for complex, dynamic control schemes. Configuring OSC Input/Output: To use OSC, first enable it in Resolume’s Preferences > OSC tab. By default, Resolume listens for incoming OSC on UDP port 7000, but this can be changed. If your OSC controller or software is on the same network, ensure both are connected to the same router (with stable latency; wired Ethernet is recommended for critical shows). Resolume announces itself on the network using ZeroConf/Bonjour when OSC input is enabled, so many OSC tools can automatically detect it as a target. If not, you can manually configure the sender with Resolume’s IP address (shown at the top of the OSC preferences) and the listening port. Once set, any OSC messages sent to Resolume’s IP:port that match its address patterns will control the corresponding parameter. Bidirectional OSC (feedback and output): Resolume Arena 7 is capable of sending OSC messages out as well, providing feedback or even controlling external systems. In Preferences > OSC, you can configure an OSC Output by specifying a target IP/hostname and port (e.g. to send to another application or device). By default, Resolume might use port 7001 for outgoing messages (if the input is 7000), but this is configurable. OSC Output is not on by default – you enable it and choose what Resolume should send. The simplest option is the preset “Output All OSC Messages”, which, when enabled, makes Resolume broadcast every interface change as an OSC message
resolume.com
. This includes clip triggers, parameter changes (via GUI, MIDI, or OSC), layer transitions, etc., on their respective addresses. Essentially, Resolume can “mirror” all its internal events out over OSC for a remote observer. This is extremely useful for feedback: for example, a custom controller app can listen to Resolume’s OSC output to update its UI LEDs or track the state of clips and effects
resolume.com
resolume.com
. However, outputting everything can create a lot of network traffic, so Resolume allows creating custom OSC output presets to filter and send only specific messages of interest
resolume.com
. To customize OSC output, you enter Edit OSC mode and enable output on the controls you care about. For instance, you could right-click the “Master Bypass” button and enable OSC output just for that toggle
resolume.com
. You can also use wildcards to quickly enable output on entire groups (e.g. all layer opacities or all clip triggers at once). Each set of enabled outputs can be saved as a preset. When active, Resolume will send an OSC message whenever those specific UI elements change. Additionally, Resolume supports sending Custom OSC messages: you can remap the outgoing address for a control to a custom OSC address if you want Resolume to speak in another system’s OSC namespace (for example, triggering a cue in another software by sending a specific OSC command). Finally, Resolume’s OSC implementation even allows OSC polling – if an external client wants to know a parameter’s current value, it can send a ? to that address, and Resolume will reply with the value. This bidirectional capability (receiving control messages and sending out state updates or custom signals) makes Resolume a central hub in interactive AV systems, bridging software, hardware controllers, and now even lighting systems via OSC.
Lumiverse and DMX Output Configuration in Resolume Arena
One of Arena’s distinguishing features is its ability to output DMX lighting data, allowing you to map your video content onto LED fixtures and lights. Resolume’s architecture for handling DMX output revolves around the concept of Lumiverses. A Lumiverse is essentially Resolume’s virtual representation of a DMX universe (512 channels) within the software
resolume.com
. In fact, Resolume treats each Lumiverse as one full DMX universe, identified by a Universe ID (and Artnet Subnet ID if applicable)
resolume.com
. You can create multiple Lumiverses if your show requires more than 512 channels of lighting; each Lumiverse can hold up to 512 channels, just like a standard DMX512 universe
resolume.com
. Adding a Lumiverse: Using Resolume’s Advanced Output configuration, you can add a new Lumiverse by clicking the “+” icon and selecting DMX Lumiverse. This will create a Lumiverse entry where you can begin patching fixtures. Initially, a new Lumiverse is not linked to any physical output – it’s a virtual container for your fixture patch and pixel mapping. You can set the Lumiverse’s DMX address base (Universe/Subnet numbers for Art-Net or stream for sACN) as needed, but by default, the first Lumiverse will be Universe 0, Subnet 0 (Art-Net) or Universe 1 (sACN).
Note: Resolume historically has focused on the Art-Net protocol for DMX over IP. As of Arena 7.x, Art-Net is fully supported for input and output. Native sACN (E1.31) support has been a frequent feature request and may be in development, but if not available, users often convert Resolume’s Art-Net output to sACN using external tools or nodes. For the context of Lumiverses, the setup is similar regardless of Art-Net vs sACN – you define universes and channels – but keep in mind you might need to stick with Art-Net or use an Art-Net to sACN bridge for now.
Patching Fixtures and Pixel Mapping: Once a Lumiverse is created, you will add DMX fixtures to it to define how Resolume’s video output is translated into DMX channel data. Resolume comes with a fixture library (and a Fixture Editor to define custom fixtures if needed). For example, if you have an RGB LED strip with 16 pixels, you would choose or create a fixture profile that has 16 RGB outputs (typically 48 DMX channels, since 16 pixels * 3 channels each = 48). When you add that fixture to the Lumiverse, Resolume will allocate the channel range for it (the first fixture starts at channel 1). If you add multiple fixtures in one Lumiverse, they will be automatically daisy-chained: e.g. the second fixture’s channels start right after the first fixture’s last channel, etc.. You can see this layout in the DMX Output tab of the Advanced Output: it shows each fixture and its starting channel within the Lumiverse. (You can also reorder fixtures or manually adjust their start addresses in this view – Resolume will warn if channels overlap). Each Lumiverse is limited to 512 channels maximum, enforcing the DMX universe limit
resolume.com
. After adding fixtures, you need to assign the video pixels that will drive those DMX channels. Each fixture appears as a “slice” or shape in the Lumiverse’s Input Selection canvas (similar to how you’d map a projector output). For an RGB fixture with multiple pixels, the fixture’s input block will be proportionally sized to accommodate all its pixels. For instance, a 16-pixel LED bar might appear as 16 small squares in a row. You can position and scale this fixture input over your composition or layer visuals. Resolume will sample the colors from the composition underneath those squares and send the color values out as DMX. Essentially, Resolume’s engine is treating your lighting fixtures like another “screen”: instead of an actual display, the Lumiverse’s fixtures pick up pixel colors from the content. The center of each small input square corresponds to the pixel’s color sample. So, if you play a video or generate visuals in that part of the composition, those colors (averaged or centered) will output to the lights. This is how video-driven pixel mapping works in Resolume Arena – you could have a looping media or generative effects in the composition, and your LED strips or panels (configured as fixtures) will mirror portions of that content in sync. For simple fixtures like a single-channel dimmer or strobe, Resolume similarly expects you to feed it an intensity value via a grayscale or luminance in the content. (The fixture’s input might just be a 1×1 pixel area in that case.) In fact, as one Resolume developer puts it: “DMX control is just numbers.” You can use greyscale (brightness) values in Resolume’s content to drive non-RGB channels. For example, if you have a dimmer or white LED fixture (1 channel), you could place a white rectangle on the composition for that fixture’s slice – the brightness of that rectangle (which you can control with opacity or effect) becomes the DMX value sent out (0–255). This means you can effectively create a DMX controller within Resolume by mapping simple shapes or dashboard controls to your fixture slices, converting visual parameters into channel levels. DMX Output via Art-Net / sACN: Once your Lumiverse and fixture mapping is set up, the next step is to output the data to the lighting network. Resolume supports network-based DMX protocols – primarily Art-Net (and if available, sACN) – to transmit the channel data. In the Advanced Output, you’ll see each Lumiverse can be assigned to a target. By right-clicking the Lumiverse in the output list, Resolume will scan for Art-Net nodes on the network and list any detected devices (e.g. Art-Net to DMX interfaces, lighting consoles, etc.). If your device appears, simply select it and Resolume will automatically configure the correct IP and universe settings for that node. If the node does not broadcast its presence (or if using sACN which relies on known addresses), you can manually specify the target IP. In the Lumiverse output settings, choose Target IP and enter the destination’s IP address, along with the Universe (and Subnet for Art-Net) number
resolume.com
resolume.com
. Resolume will then send the DMX data to that IP. It’s crucial that the Resolume machine and the lighting device are on the same IP network and subnet for this to work – e.g. set them both to a 2.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x IP range if following Art-Net conventions. If you’re running multiple Lumiverses, you can send each to a different universe on the same node, or even to entirely different nodes (for instance, one Lumiverse’s target could be an Art-Net interface driving LED strips, and another Lumiverse could be sending to a media server or lighting console listening on another universe). Resolume’s DMX Preferences tab lets you choose the network interface for DMX output if your computer has multiple NICs. Be sure to select the correct adapter (e.g. the wired Ethernet port connected to the lighting network) in Preferences, otherwise Resolume might be outputting Art-Net on the wrong interface (e.g. a disconnected WiFi). Resolume supports both unicast and broadcast transmission. By default, targeting a specific IP or node is unicast. But you can also choose a Broadcast mode, which will send the DMX data to all devices on the network segment
resolume.com
. Broadcast can be handy if you have multiple receivers that need the same data or if you don’t know the node’s IP. However, broadcasting multiple universes can quickly saturate network bandwidth. The Resolume team recommends using unicast (specific node IPs) or at least a robust gigabit network if you go beyond ~30 universes, as broadcast traffic for hundreds of universes is inefficient
resolume.com
. In practice, for large installations with many universes, sACN’s multicast approach would be preferable, but until native sACN is supported, you may use Art-Net broadcast with caution or use external converters to multicast. Finally, note that Resolume Arena 7 (and 6) does not support USB-DMX dongles like the Enttec Pro Mk2 directly
resolume.com
. The developers chose to support only network-based DMX protocols for stability and scalability
resolume.com
. So ensure you have an Art-Net/sACN node or interface to get the data to physical DMX lines, if controlling traditional fixtures.
Controlling DMX Outputs via OSC Commands (OSC-to-DMX Examples)
With OSC and Lumiverse DMX in place, you can set up powerful integrations: for example, using OSC messages from an external source to control lighting parameters in Resolume, or conversely having Resolume’s output trigger events elsewhere. Here we focus on how OSC commands can manipulate Resolume parameters that result in DMX output changes, effectively using Resolume as an OSC-driven lighting controller. Because Resolume’s DMX output is inherently tied to its composition/layer content, controlling the lights via OSC often means controlling the content or parameters that affect that content. In practice, you set up your Lumiverse mapping to respond to certain layers or effects, and then use OSC to tweak those. Let’s break down a few scenarios:
Triggering Lighting Cues via OSC: You can dedicate a layer (or several layers) in Resolume for lighting cues, with pre-made clips that correspond to lighting looks or animations. For instance, Layer 5 might contain solid color clips (red, blue, green, etc.) or pattern clips for your LED strips. Using OSC, an external controller (like TouchOSC on a tablet or a timeline software) can trigger these clips on cue. For example, sending an OSC message to /composition/layers/5/clips/2/connect 1 will launch clip 2 on layer 5. If clip 2 was a solid blue color mapped to your Lumiverse fixtures, all those fixtures will turn blue. Another OSC message could trigger a strobe clip or a chase animation clip to run on the lights. This method essentially treats Resolume as a media server for lighting content, where OSC acts as the “remote playback” control for lighting looks.
Direct Parameter Control (Intensity, Color): Suppose instead of discrete clips, you want smooth control of a light parameter like dimmer intensity. One efficient approach is to use Resolume’s layer opacity or dashboard faders mapped to Lumiverse output. For example, you could have Layer 1 dedicated to a white color for a set of fixtures. The actual output intensity of those fixtures could be tied to the opacity of Layer 1 (if the layer is fully opaque white, the lights output at full 100%; if half-transparent, lights output 50%, etc.). An OSC message like /composition/layers/1/video/opacity 0.5 would then dim that layer to 50% opacity, and consequently the Lumiverse output would be 50% intensity. This gives you a smooth fade control via OSC. In a more modular setup, you might use Resolume’s Dashboard (a set of global knobs/sliders) and assign one of those to control the brightness of a lighting group. Each dashboard control itself has an OSC address (e.g. /composition/dashboard/1 for the first knob) and can be adjusted with a 0.0–1.0 value. By sending, say, /composition/dashboard/1 1.0, you could turn a group of lights fully on, whereas /composition/dashboard/1 0.0 would turn them off. Internally, that dashboard could be linked (via Resolume’s parameter linking) to the intensity of a Colorize effect or the opacity of a layer that feeds the Lumiverse. This approach shows how OSC can indirectly set DMX channel values by controlling the visuals that drive those channels.
Color Mixing Example: If your fixtures are RGB, you might want to control their color via OSC. One method is to use Resolume’s built-in color palette or a solid color generator. For instance, put a Solid Color source on Layer 2 covering your fixture slice, which allows you to set an RGB color for that layer. The Solid Color effect has an OSC-addressable color picker (e.g. /composition/layers/2/clips/1/video/source/color). An OSC client could send a color message to that address to change the color on the fly. If sending an OSC color type is not feasible, another way is to break color into components: you might have three layers or effects each controlling R, G, B channels separately (or use Resolume’s Colorize / Hue Rotate effects on one layer). Then by sending OSC floats to those, you adjust the color mix. For example, you might assign Dashboard knob 2,3,4 to Red, Green, Blue intensities respectively for a fixture group. These would have addresses /composition/dashboard/2 etc., and an external software could output color fades by sending appropriate sequences of values (much like a lighting console sending DMX, but here via OSC to Resolume). While not as straightforward as a dedicated lighting console, this technique leverages Resolume’s content engine to translate OSC into multi-channel DMX output changes.
Dynamic Effects via OSC: Because Resolume can apply video effects to content that is driving lights, you can also control those effects by OSC to achieve dynamic lighting. For instance, you could have a Blink or Strobe effect on a layer of solid color. The speed or enable/disable of that effect has an OSC address. By toggling it via OSC (e.g. /composition/layers/1/clips/1/video/effects/strobe/active 1 to enable), you could instantly engage a strobe on the lights. Similarly, effect parameters like an LFO rate, a step sequencer, color chaser patterns – all can be modulated by OSC if they’re applied in Resolume. This essentially means you can design complex lighting animations in Resolume (using its video effects or even the companion Resolume Wire patches) and trigger or modulate them remotely. One could imagine an interactive installation where a sensor feeds data to a PC that then sends OSC to Resolume to tweak effect parameters, causing lights to react in real-time.
In all these cases, the key is that Resolume’s OSC addresses become proxies for lighting control. There is no OSC address that directly says “DMX channel 5 to value 200” – instead, you control a visual element that results in DMX channel 5 changing. This indirect mapping is powerful, as it allows you to leverage Resolume’s visual logic (transitions, effects, even audio-reactivity) for lighting. Advanced users have pushed this further by creating dedicated “DMX control layers” in their composition. For example, one technique is to create a group of layers labeled “DMX” and have one layer per DMX channel you want to manually control. You can place tiny white clips in those layers (one pixel = one channel) and then map each layer’s opacity to a MIDI fader or OSC message. By adjusting those opacities, you effectively send 0–255 to each channel individually
resolume.com
. This was actually used to control non-RGB parameters like moving head pan/tilt, gobo, etc., by converting fader movements into brightness of a pixel that drives that channel. It’s a bit of a hack, but it demonstrates that any DMX channel can be “addressed” via some OSC-accessible control in Resolume. As long as you set up a slice/fixture for that channel and tie it to a controllable value in the comp, you can reach it with OSC. Resolume’s own developers have even provided a Wire patch called DMXHelper to simplify mapping grayscale values to fixtures. Routing OSC to DMX Endpoints: Another angle is using Resolume as a bridge between protocols. For instance, maybe you have a device or software that only speaks OSC but you need to control traditional DMX lights. You can send OSC into Resolume and let Resolume output the corresponding DMX. Conversely, if you have a lighting console sending Art-Net and you want to automate Resolume (but you only have Avenue which lacks DMX input), you could convert Art-Net to OSC (as shown by a user with the MIDIMonster tool). In any complex show control system, Resolume can sit in the middle: taking OSC cues from timeline software or interactive apps, and outputting video + lighting changes together. For example, a theatre might use QLab or an Ableton timeline to send OSC commands to Resolume like “start clip, set intensity X, set color Y” at specific times, and Resolume handles both projecting visuals and turning on lighting fixtures in sync. In summary, by careful mapping, OSC commands can effectively target Lumiverse output. Whether it’s triggering preset looks or continuously adjusting levels, OSC gives you remote, programmable control over Resolume’s DMX outputs. This opens up integration with coding environments (Processing, TouchDesigner, Max, etc.), web interfaces, or any OSC-enabled device to control lights through Resolume’s engine.
Best Practices for OSC and DMX Setup in Resolume
Setting up a reliable OSC and DMX environment requires attention to network configuration and show design. Here are some best practices and tips for Resolume Arena 7:
Network Configuration: For both OSC and Art-Net/sACN, a stable network is crucial. Use wired Ethernet for show-critical connections whenever possible. OSC packets are lightweight, but on Wi-Fi they can still suffer from interference or packet loss – especially in crowded venues. If using Wi-Fi (for a tablet controller, for example), ensure a dedicated router and minimal traffic. For Art-Net, set static IP addresses in the same range (e.g. 2.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x with 255.0.0.0 mask, or as required by your lighting network). Ensure the correct network adapter is selected in Resolume’s DMX Preferences. It’s easy to overlook this if your machine has Wi-Fi and Ethernet – Resolume might default to the wrong one, and you’ll wonder why no node is found or lights don’t respond. So double-check the adapter and consider disabling unused interfaces during show time to avoid confusion.
Art-Net/sACN Node Setup: If Resolume doesn’t auto-detect your node, don’t panic. You can always manually configure the target IP and universe
resolume.com
. Make sure the node’s universe matches the Lumiverse’s universe number. Many Art-Net devices use Universe 0 as the first universe (which corresponds to “Universe 1” in some lighting software – remember Art-Net uses a 0-based universe count by default). If controlling multiple devices, you might assign Lumiverse 1 to Universe 0 (Device A), Lumiverse 2 to Universe 1 (Device B), etc. If using sACN via an Art-Net/sACN converter, set the correct sACN universe (which is often 1-based). Always test connectivity: many DMX nodes have a status LED or web interface to confirm data reception. Use Resolume’s ability to output a test pattern (like play a white flash or color chase) to see if the lights respond as expected, and use the node’s tools (if any) to verify data.
Avoiding Conflicts: OSC uses UDP ports – ensure no other application on your Resolume machine is using the same incoming OSC port (7000 by default) to avoid conflicts. If running multiple instances or a backup machine, configure each with unique ports. Similarly, only one application should be outputting on a given Art-Net universe on the network, unless you intentionally merge signals. If you do need to combine signals (say a lighting console and Resolume both controlling the same fixtures), consider using Art-Net merge in the node or sACN priority features. Alternatively, segregate DMX control responsibilities by universe or channel ranges to prevent overlap. Resolume can be used in parallel with a console if, for example, the console moves the lights and Resolume only sends color data which the console then merges (HTP) with its own data.
OSC Address Management: In complex setups, keep a reference of important OSC addresses you’ll be using. While Resolume doesn’t provide a static full list (since addresses depend on comp structure), you can document the addresses by checking the OSC panel for each control. It might help to use consistent layer and clip ordering so that the addresses remain predictable (/layers/1, /layers/2, etc., corresponding to certain fixture groups or effects). If using a programming environment to send OSC, consider implementing a retry or feedback mechanism – for example, use Resolume’s OSC feedback to confirm a command was received. You can enable logging of incoming messages in Resolume’s OSC preferences (it shows the last 200 messages) to debug whether your commands are coming through.
Optimizing OSC Traffic: Only send OSC as frequently as needed. Spamming many messages (especially if using something like an OSC-based fader that sends dozens of values per second) can flood the network or Resolume. If you have a very fast-changing parameter (e.g. an audio-driven value), consider if it could be handled inside Resolume (using audio analysis or an envelope) rather than streaming over OSC continuously. For OSC output, take advantage of Resolume’s output presets to limit traffic to what you need. For instance, if an external app only needs to know when a particular clip launches, you don’t need “Output All OSC” (which would send everything); just enable that clip’s address for output. This keeps network usage light and reduces parsing work on the receiving end.
Content & Composition Planning: Design your Resolume composition with lighting integration in mind. It can be helpful to group all lighting-related layers in one group (e.g. a group named “Lights” or “Lumiverse Output”) and video screens in another. That way you can apply certain effects globally to lights without affecting screen content. Use clearly named fixtures and slices (e.g. label fixtures in Advanced Output as “LED Strip Left” etc.) – these names won’t show up in OSC but will keep you organized. Also, test the limits: sending video to 10+ universes of LEDs is intense on both GPU (rendering) and network (DMX data). If you plan a big LED installation, ensure your system can handle the frame rate with that many channels. Resolume 7 introduced Auto DMX Universe Spanning improvements and performance tweaks, but always do a dry run for large channel counts.
Timing and Sync: OSC messages can introduce slight latency (order of milliseconds), which is usually negligible. However, if you need frame-perfect sync between video and lighting (e.g. a flash on screen with a beat), drive them both from Resolume’s timeline if possible (rather than sending OSC live for the flash). For example, triggering both a visual clip and a lighting clip together in Resolume ensures they sync. If an external control triggers them via OSC, consider sending a single OSC bundle containing both the visual trigger and lighting trigger addresses in one go (Resolume will process them together). Resolume supports OSC bundles (configurable in prefs), so you can use that to your advantage for simultaneous parameter changes.
Safety and Fallbacks: In live scenarios, have a way to quickly take down or override the lights if needed. Since Resolume’s DMX output is video-driven, an easy “all black” is to use the Composition Bypass (which has an OSC address too!). You might map a panic button OSC message to /composition/video/blackout 1 (if such exists) or simply to set all your light layers’ opacities to 0. Similarly, keep intensity levels in check – you can use Resolume’s DMX Fixture profiles to limit max brightness if desired (by setting range in fixture or using the Range control on DMX shortcuts when using DMX input). While that Range option is for DMX-in, the concept applies: avoid sending unintended full values by clamping in your OSC-sending logic.
Following these practices will help ensure that your OSC control is responsive and your DMX output is reliable throughout the show.
Exposing Lumiverse Endpoints for External Control and Integration
In many projects, you’ll want to integrate Resolume’s lighting output with other systems – from traditional lighting desks to interactive installations or even game engines. The goal is often to treat each Lumiverse or fixture as an addressable endpoint that other controllers can influence. While Resolume doesn’t expose a direct API call like “set channel 100 to 255” on Lumiverse 2 (since it drives channels via video), you can still effectively expose controllable endpoints by structuring your show and using OSC/DMX strategically. Using Lumiverse with Lighting Consoles: One common integration is running Resolume alongside a lighting console (such as grandMA, ETC Eos, etc.). There are two ways this typically happens:
Lighting desk controlling Resolume visuals: Here, the console sends DMX or OSC to Resolume to trigger and adjust visuals (for example, the LD brings in a video effect via a fader). Resolume Arena supports DMX input via Lumiverse as well – you can create a Lumiverse in Resolume designated for input (this is essentially the “DMX Shortcuts” feature). Each Lumiverse input listens to a specific Art-Net subnet/universe for incoming channel values. You then map those channels to Resolume parameters just like mapping a MIDI controller. This means a lighting console could send Art-Net on universe 0, channel 1 to control Resolume’s layer opacity, channel 2 to trigger a clip, etc., by setting up DMX shortcuts in Resolume. The Lumiverse abstraction helps here: you can re-route which actual Art-Net universe Resolume listens on without reprogramming the shortcuts. This scenario exposes Resolume’s features to the console – but it’s essentially the reverse of what we focus on in this essay (it’s controlling Resolume via DMX). Still, it’s good to know that Lumiverses are used for input as well, not just output.
Resolume controlling lights vs. console controlling lights: Sometimes both a console and Resolume output to the rig, and you want them integrated. Since two sources might fight over the same fixture, a typical approach is to split responsibilities – e.g. the console handles moving light positioning, shutters, etc., while Resolume handles color or pixelmapped content on LED fixtures. This can be achieved by output merging. If the fixtures support multiple Art-Net/sACN sources with HTP (highest-takes-precedence) merge, you can have Resolume send just the color channels while the console sends dimmer and pan/tilt. Another approach is to input Resolume’s output into the console. For example, some consoles or media servers can receive Art-Net from Resolume as if it were another input source. The console op could then fade Resolume’s feed in or out, apply a master dimmer, etc. In such a case, Resolume’s Lumiverse endpoints are the console’s inputs, effectively. If the console doesn’t accept merge, you could dedicate certain universes to Resolume (e.g. LED strips on universe 10-15 come only from Resolume, while conventional lights on other universes come from the desk).
OSC Integration with Other Software: OSC is often the glue for creative integrations. For instance, interactive art pieces might use sensors and creative coding (TouchDesigner, Unity, Max/MSP) to generate OSC that drive both visuals and lights through Resolume. Treat each aspect of the Lumiverse as an OSC-addressable node by creating an OSC-accessible control in Resolume that influences it. If you want an external program to control individual LED pixels, one brute-force way is to set up an OSC address for each pixel’s intensity – but sending hundreds of OSC messages per frame is not practical. Instead, consider higher-level control: send an OSC message for “background color” or “pattern selection” and let Resolume internally generate the per-pixel output. For example, an Unreal Engine project might send an OSC command like /scene/param/energy 0.8 to Resolume, and inside Resolume that “energy” parameter could drive a Wire patch that modulates the LED pattern brightness or color. In this way, the endpoint exposed to the external system is a meaningful parameter (energy, color theme, etc.) rather than raw channels. Resolume then translates that to all the channel changes on the Lumiverse. This is a high-level integration strategy that abstracts the lighting control, making it easier to manage from an external system. That said, if needed, you can achieve near-direct channel control via OSC by the earlier mentioned technique of dedicated layers per channel. This effectively exposes a channel as an OSC address (the layer opacity or effect value). A custom integration might label these addresses as needed (for example, using the Custom OSC Output feature you could even alias them – but simpler is to document that “Layer 10 opacity = Fixture X dimmer”). Then something like a Node.js web server or a mobile app could send OSC on those addresses based on user input (e.g. faders on a webpage controlling individual lights). Indeed, projects have been done where a web interface controls Resolume via OSC, enabling remote or multi-user lighting control, with Resolume acting as the processor that outputs Art-Net. Multi-System Synchronization: If you aim to integrate with other visual systems (like another media server, or a game engine for AR/VR), you might use OSC to share state and ensure everything is in sync. Resolume’s OSC output can send cues to others – for example, when a clip starts, Resolume could send a custom OSC message to a Unity application to trigger an event. Conversely, that application might control Resolume’s lumiverse content via OSC. This bidirectional talk can link disparate systems into one coherent show control network. Lumiverse endpoints (the lights) then become a shared resource – perhaps the game engine calculates a desired color based on gameplay, sends it to Resolume, which then outputs to real lights via DMX, creating a mixed reality experience. APIs and Future: It’s worth mentioning that Resolume 7 also introduced a REST/HTTP API and WebSocket API. These aren’t directly tied to Lumiverse control, but they open additional ways to integrate with external systems (e.g. a web dashboard could control Resolume without OSC). However, OSC remains the most real-time and widely-used method for interactive control. In conclusion, exposing Lumiverse endpoints is typically achieved by designing clear control points in Resolume (layers, effects, dashboard knobs) that correspond to the lighting outputs, and then using OSC or DMX messages to drive those points externally. It requires a bit of planning, but once set up, external systems can seamlessly treat Resolume-driven lights as part of their domain. Whether it’s a lighting desk syncing video and lights together, a custom app driving an interactive light show, or an installation merging generative graphics with LED strips, Resolume Arena 7 provides the tools (OSC mapping, Lumiverse pixel mapping, and flexible routing) to make it happen. By leveraging these, developers and show designers can integrate lighting (Lumiverses) and control (OSC) in a creative, robust way – effectively using Resolume as a bridge between the visual and lighting aspects of a performance.

# Routing & Signal Configs

This folder defines the system behavior using JSON.

- `routing_map.json`: Main list of inputâ†’output mappings.
- `input_aliases.json`: Friendly names for raw input signals.
- `endpoints.json`: Known output destinations with IP, port, etc.

All JSON files are hot-reloadable in TouchDesigner and version-controlled via GitHub.
